          <p>Me as Abegail My skills is 
       Playing a guitar
       Playing the guitar offers a lot of benefits—it's a versatile instrument, easy to carry around, and allows you to express creativity through music. Plus, it can be really fun to learn and can bring a sense of accomplishment when you master new songs or techniques</p>
         
          <h1>Challenging</h1>
          <img src="./IMG_20250203_103428.jpg"  alt="chalenge" class="chalenge">
          <p>Rachel, These things are challenging for me because they require special skills, determination, and courage. Creating a website and formulas in Math is difficult because they require the right knowledge, logic, and patience
       Meanwhile, eating sour or spicy food is a challenge for my taste buds and endurance. Giving reports in front of the class is difficult for me because it requires confidence, clear expression, and readiness to accept others' opinions. Despite these challenges, I believe I can overcome them through continuous practice and a positive outlook."</p>
       
       <img src="./IMG_20250203_103417.jpg" alt="slow" class="slow">
       <p>Abegail, Being a "slow learner" generally refers to someone who takes more time than others to understand or master new concepts, skills, or tasks. It doesn't mean that the person is incapable or less intelligent; rather, it might mean they need a different pace or approach to learning compared to others. Some people may
        need more repetition, more detailed explanations, or different teaching methods to grasp something. </p>
